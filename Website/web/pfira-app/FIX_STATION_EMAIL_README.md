# 🔧 Fix for Station User Email Template Issue

## Problem Identified
You were receiving citizen emails instead of station user emails because:
1. **Function Call Issue**: The `createStationUser` function was incorrectly calling the email function
2. **Template Confusion**: The system was mixing up citizen and station user email templates
3. **Missing Logging**: No clear indication of which email function was being called

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Function Call**
- **Before**: `const { sendStationUserWelcomeEmail } = require('./index');`
- **After**: `await exports.sendStationUserWelcomeEmail(...)`
- **Why**: The `require('./index')` was causing conflicts and calling the wrong function

### 2. **Enhanced Email Function**
- **Clear Identification**: Added "Template: template_p7tkyfi" to station user emails
- **Role Specification**: Clearly marked as "Station User (Responder)" 
- **Template ID**: Added your template ID `template_p7tkyfi` to the email

### 3. **Added Debug Logging**
- **Console Logs**: Added detailed logging for every step
- **Email Tracking**: Clear indication of which email function is called
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages and debugging info

### 4. **Test Function**
- **`testStationUserEmail`**: New function to test email functionality
- **Direct Testing**: Can test email without creating full user account
- **Debugging**: Helps isolate email issues from user creation issues

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. **Deploy Updated Functions**
```bash
cd "C:\Users\HP\Documents\CAPSTONE FILES\Project FIRA Mobile\functions"
npm run deploy
```

### 2. **Test the Fix**
After deployment, test by:
1. **Create a new station user** in your web app
2. **Check console logs** for detailed process tracking
3. **Verify email received** is for station users (not citizens)
4. **Check email content** includes "Template: template_p7tkyfi"

### 3. **Test Email Function Directly**
Use the new test function:
```javascript
// In browser console or test page
const testStationUserEmail = httpsCallable(functions, 'testStationUserEmail');
testStationUserEmail({
  email: 'your-test-email@example.com',
  firstName: 'Test',
  lastName: 'User',
  position: 'Firefighter',
  location: 'Lahug',
  password: 'testpass123'
});
```

## 🔍 What to Look For

### **In Console Logs:**
```
🚀 Creating station user: {email: "...", firstName: "...", ...}
🔐 Creating Firebase Auth user...
✅ Firebase Auth user created: [uid]
💾 Storing user data in Firestore...
✅ User data stored in Firestore
📧 Sending station user welcome email...
📧 Sending station user welcome email to: [email] (Template: template_p7tkyfi)
✅ Station user welcome email sent successfully
```

### **In Email Subject:**
- **Correct**: "Welcome to Project FIRA - Station User Account Created"
- **Wrong**: "Welcome to Project FIRA - Your Account Credentials"

### **In Email Content:**
- **Correct**: "Station User Account Created Successfully!" + "Template: template_p7tkyfi"
- **Wrong**: "Your account has been successfully created by an administrator"

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Deploy updated functions
- [ ] Create new station user
- [ ] Check console logs for station user process
- [ ] Verify email subject mentions "Station User"
- [ ] Confirm email includes template ID `template_p7tkyfi`
- [ ] Verify email content is station-specific (not citizen)
- [ ] Test email function directly if needed

## 🐛 If Issues Persist

### **Check Firebase Functions Logs:**
```bash
firebase functions:log
```

### **Verify Function Names:**
- `createStationUser` - Creates station user accounts
- `sendStationUserWelcomeEmail` - Sends station user emails
- `sendWelcomeEmail` - Sends citizen emails (NOT for station users)

### **Test Individual Functions:**
1. Test `testStationUserEmail` first
2. Then test full `createStationUser` process
3. Check logs for any error messages

## 📧 Email Template Verification

Your station user emails should now clearly show:
- **Template ID**: `template_p7tkyfi`
- **Role**: Station User (Responder)
- **Content**: Station-specific information
- **Subject**: Station User Account Created

The citizen email function remains completely separate and should not interfere with station user emails anymore.
